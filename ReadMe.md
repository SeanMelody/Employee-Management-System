<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LICENSE-mit-green"/>

## Description

    A node and mySql project you can use to add, view, update and delete employees.
    By running node app.js in the terminal, I have created using node, mysql, and vanilla javascript an employee management system.
    You are able to add, view, update or delete departments, roles and employees!
    In addition, you can view employees by manager, update employees managers and roles, as well as view the total salaries for the employees in a department.

## Thank you to:

Thank you to Mike S from Stack overflow who answered a question in 2012, that was similar to an error I was getting.
Without the post that he answered, I would not have been able to find out how to view employees by manager!  Yeay!
